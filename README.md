Crepes are originated from France. They are a __*delicious*__ delicate dessert that can transform from *sweet* to **savory**. Some toppings to include on your crepes include: 

*Sweet*
  - Strawberries
  - Bananas
  - Nutella
  - Whipped Cream

<br>**Savory**
  - Cheese
  - Meat (of your choice)


The toppings you choose depend on your mood! Crepes are enjoyed all around the world for breakfast lunch and dinner. There are many differnet recipes out there with no diary; however, in comparing the two, the milk crepes are smoother and look more "crepe like". But, for my non-dairy people, here's my favorite [No Milk Crepe Recipe](https://skinnyms.com/dairy-free-crepes/)
Here's my recipe for milk crepes:

### Ingredients
  - 1 cup of Milk
  - 1 cup of flour
  - 1/4 cup of water
  - 3 tbsp of butter
  - 2 eggs
  - Oil (so the crepes don't stick on the pan)
