<br>Crepes are originated from France. They are a __*delicious*__ delicate dessert that can transform from *sweet* to **savory**. Crepes are my favorite comfort food and super duper easy to make! Some toppings to include on your crepes include: 

*Sweet*
  - Strawberries
  - Bananas
  - Nutella
  - Whipped Cream

<br>**Savory**
  - Cheese
  - Meat (of your choice)


The toppings you choose depend on your mood! Crepes are enjoyed all around the world for breakfast, lunch and dinner. There are many differnet recipes out there with no diary; however, in comparing the two, the milk crepes are smoother and look more "crepe like". But, for my non-dairy people, here's my favorite [No Milk Crepe Recipe](https://skinnyms.com/dairy-free-crepes/)
Here's my recipe for milk crepes:

### Ingredients
  - 1 cup of Milk
  - 1 cup of flour
  - 1/4 cup of water
  - 3 tbsp of butter
  - 2 eggs
  - Oil (so the crepes don't stick on the pan)

### Steps: 
  1. Pour flour, milk, water, butter, and eggs all in one mixing bowl (pour liquids last)
  2. Mix thouroughly, make sure batter is thick enough to make a figure 8 shape with it, but thinner than cake batter
  3. Pour oil onto the pant iwth high heat
  4. Get a ladle, use it to spread it onto a pan
  5. Flip once the side of the crepe facing the stove starts forming brown spots

#### Extra!
  - You can add bananas or strawberries or other toppings to the crepe, fold in half and serve!!
